# Personal Portfolio Webpage

This is my final project for the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp. The goal was to build a personal portfolio that showcases a few of my projects, includes smooth navigation, and is responsive across screen sizes.

## Requirements

- `#welcome-section` with a heading  
- `#projects` section with clickable project tiles  
- `#navbar` fixed to the top with links to page sections  
- `#profile-link` that opens my GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab  
- Responsive layout using at least one media query  
- Full viewport height welcome section

## Features

- Fully responsive using HTML and CSS  
- Fixed top navigation bar  
- Media query for mobile optimization  
- Clean layout with personal styling

## Tools Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- A lot of copy-paste then edit-and-fix coding energy
